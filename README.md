# StarkNet
Here are my solutions of:
 - ERC721 on StarkNet (https://github.com/l-henri/starknet-erc721)
 - ERC20 on StarkNet (https://github.com/l-henri/starknet-erc20)

init.cairo is just a blank contract I use to quickly start with a new contract with some default structure.

Try not to copy and paste them (or at least please understand what has been done)

I used [Nile](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/nile) to compile and deploy the contracts.\
I used the provided python file to convert data to FELT.

It should be possible to compile every contract existing in the Solution folder, the folder contracts is just there so that it is possible to compile the files.
